# Description of the Competition
A large restaurant chain owns restaurants located along major highways. The average revenue of a restaurant located at distance 𝑥 from the highway is 𝑅(𝑥). For simplicity, the variable distance to the highway is normalized to be in the interval [1,2]. The function 𝑅(𝑥) is unknown. The goal of this competition is to predict the value of 𝑅(𝑥) for several values of distances to the highway. Currently, the restaurant chain is located at 40 different locations. You will have access to
$ {(𝑥𝑖,𝑅(𝑥𝑖))}^{30}_{𝑖=1} $ , i.e., the distance to the highway and average revenue for 30 of these restaurants. Using these data, you must submit a prediction of average revenue for the remaining 10 restaurants, using their distances to the highway.

You will find the necessary datasets in the Data tab. You can send up to 10 different submissions each day until the end of the competition. The deadline of the competition is Sunday September 26th at 23:59:59.
